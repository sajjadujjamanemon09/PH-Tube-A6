                    <li> 'null' is usually assigned by a programmer to indicate that a variable intentionally has no value.</li>
                    <li> It is an object type.</li>
                    <li> When you want to indicate that a variable is expected to hold an object or value later in the program but doesn't yet have a meaningful value, you can initialize it with null.</li>
